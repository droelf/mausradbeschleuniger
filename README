What?

mausradbeschleuniger is a simple mouse wheel accelerator for Linux.


How?

mausradbeschleuniger grabs the raw mouse events using the /dev/input/eventX device.
If the time difference between consecutive mouse wheel events in the same direction falls below an adjustable threshold, additional mouse wheel events are fed to the kernel by the /dev/uinput device.
This small tool is written in python, using the fantastic pyinputevent classes from https://github.com/rmt/pyinputevent

Usage

Make sure your kernel has /dev/uinput enabled (or uinput loaded as module). Find out which input device your mouse is (try: cat /dev/input/eventX, if you see some garbled text while moving the mouse, it's the right device).
Since /dev/input/eventX and /dev/uinput are read/writeable only by root by default, it might be a good idea to edit your udev configuration to allow a normal user access to it.
See http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gizmod/index.php?title=HOWTO_-_Setting_Input_Device_Permissions_-_Creating_a_udev_Rule for further information.
My current /etc/udev/rules.d/evdev_uinput.rules looks like this (allowing all users in the "input" group rw access to both devices):

KERNEL=="event*",       NAME="input/%k", MODE:="660", GROUP="input"
KERNEL=="uinput",       NAME="%k", MODE:="660", GROUP="input"

start mausradbeschleuinger:

python ./mausradbeschleuniger <input device> <threshold (ms)> <speedup>

e.g.

python ./mausradbeschleuniger /dev/input/event4 20 4
(threshold 20ms, 4 additional events will be sent for every single wheel event)

Starting with speedup=0 will output the actual time differences and print out if the acceleration would engage.
